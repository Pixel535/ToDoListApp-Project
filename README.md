# ToDoListApp - Project
The project was done as part of the Internet and mobile technologies course for the Military University of Technology

# Description
ToDoListApp is an app based on how a typical ToDo app works. Users can create their account, 
log in to it and add their tasks to it (CRUD operations). When logging in, a JWT token is created 
which protects against the entry of unauthorised users. An additional feature is that the user can 
‘pay’ for additional style on the site. To do this, the application connects to the PayPal API, which 
allows the user to do so. Once the user has completed the transaction, they are returned to the main page 
of the app with the additional feature. In addition to the backend and frontend, this project also includes 
a mobile application for Android. This application works identically to the web application and connects to the 
backend of the application using the Retrofit library. The entire project was written in Java, React and SpringBoot 
in Intellij and in Java in Android Studio.
